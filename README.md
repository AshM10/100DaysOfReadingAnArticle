## Day 02

### [Top 14 Cutting-Edge Web Development Trends in 2023](https://yellow.systems/blog/web-development-future-trends)

- Frontend development trends
The time when a front-end web developer only needed to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is long gone. So, the way to keep pace with a rapidly changing environment is to watch the latest front-end technologies.

- Why JavaScript rocks?
  - Itâ€™s an object-based and dynamic language used both on the client side and the server side.
  - Itâ€™s supported by many browsers, such as Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.
  - Interactivity is excellent because JavaScript is a language that gives the web page its structure and style.
  - Many libraries and frameworks are available.
  
- Jamstack
  - In the JAMstack definition (which appeared in 2015), JAM stands for JavaScript, API, and Markup, but now "Jamstack" is widely used. This is how Mathias Biilmann, the CEO and co-founder of Netlify, defines the term: "Itâ€™s a web development infrastructure based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup."
  
- Mobile-first Approach in Web Development
  - Focus on vertical orientation rather than landscape one, and on functions done with a touchscreen. 
  - Set up meta viewport tags to help browsers change how pages are scaled.
  - Use different layout methods, e.g. Grid, Multi-Column, or Flexbox, to make layouts fit the viewport.
  - Use CSS queries to change the size of things based on what the devices can do.

- Headless Architecture for Content Management

### [React Just Got Even More Awesome](https://dev.to/dayvster/react-just-got-even-more-awesome-f15)
- by [Dayvster](https://dev.to/dayvster)

How does the use hook work?
- Similary to await it simply unwraps the value of a promise, meaning that any async behaviour can be wrapped in a use hook now and react will natively handle the promise for us.
